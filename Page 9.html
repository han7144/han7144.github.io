The arctic fox (vulpes lagopus) is a small fox found in the northern hemisphere. They live in cold climates and are well adapted to frigid environments. It is a well-known fact about arctic foxes that they are white to blend in with the snowy white arctic landscape, but what happens to them in the summer when parts of the tundra melt. Do arctic foxes change color? <br>
Yes, arctic foxes change the color of their fur depending on the season which makes it harder for predators to spot them. The arctic fox coat color will be white during winter months to blend in with the snow, then they will switch to earthy tones such as brown or grey during summer months. <br>
Arctic foxes are best known for their thick white fur that helps them blend in with the snow of the arctic and ice floes. This provides camouflage to protect them from their predators.<br>

However, as the snow melts in the warmer months of the year and they migrate to areas with less snowfall, they donâ€™t keep their white fur as this would make them too obvious to predators.
